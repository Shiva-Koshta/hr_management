## Usage Tips

1. **Testing Reorder Failures**: Drag jobs multiple times. ~10% of reorders will fail and rollback.

2. **Testing Virtualization**: Scroll through 1000 candidates smoothly in the list view.

3. **Testing Conditional Questions**: In assessment builder, create a Yes/No question, then add a follow-up question that only shows when "Yes" is selected.

4. **Testing Follow-up**: Mark several candidates for follow-up, then use the filter to see only those candidates.

5. **Testing Assessment Completion**: Submit an assessment in preview mode, then check the candidate profile to see completion status.

For more information, see [README.md](README.md) and [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).
